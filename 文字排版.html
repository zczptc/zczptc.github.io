<p>白色的花瓣，住进了春天。季节的水墨，辗转于素色的纸笺，<span>让风雨相约，在这一刻轻轻坠落，让心，</span>枕半刻清闲，不问，时光过尽千帆，不说，半壁柴米烟火，只写，半弯春情，装点了四月的羞涩。</p>	
<p>The weather is cold. And I caught a fever. I felt uncomfortable this morning. I told my mother when she asked me to get up. Then she said I was sick and helped me to ask my teacher for sick leave. Then my mother took me to the hospital. The doctor gave me some medicine and an injection. I have to lie on the bed for a whole day. I want to be good soon.</p>
